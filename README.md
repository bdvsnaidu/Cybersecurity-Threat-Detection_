# Cybersecurity-Threat-Detection_

The growing sophistication of cyber threats, coupled with the 
increasing complexity of modern network infrastructures, has rendered 
traditional rule-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) insufficient for 
protecting against contemporary cyberattacks. In response, the adoption 
of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms has gained 
significant traction as a proactive solution for enhancing network security 
through improved detection and mitigation of threats. This paper presents 
a comprehensive review and comparison of various ML and DL models 
for intrusion detection, assessing their effectiveness across key 
performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The 
study highlights the strengths and weaknesses of models including 
Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, Naive Bayes, and 
advanced DL architectures like VGG16. Using diverse datasets, it 
demonstrates how certain models, such as Random Forest and Extra 
Trees, excel in specific scenarios based on dataset characteristics and 
threat types. The challenges associated with deploying ML-driven 
intrusion detection systems in real-world environments, including data 
scarcity, adversarial attacks, model interpretability, and computational 
overhead, are also discussed. The insights provided aim to guide 
cybersecurity professionals in selecting and optimizing ML-based models 
to bolster defenses against evolving cyber threats.
